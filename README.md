# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Michael and I am learning to code so that I may become a software engineer.
I have worked in the IT industry for over 3 years as a Business Analyst, Systems Analyst and Blue Prism Developer.
As of October 2020 I will be attending the University of London studying towards a BSc in Computer Science.
I cannot wait!!
